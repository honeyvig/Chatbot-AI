# Chatbot-AI
build a chat bot and AI stuff where this is integrated with multiple systems like ERP systems. And hosted chatbot Public.
-------------
To build a chatbot that integrates with multiple systems, such as ERP systems, and is publicly hosted, we can follow a systematic approach. We will integrate the chatbot with various systems (e.g., ERP) via APIs and build the chatbot using a popular platform like Dialogflow or Rasa. The chatbot will be hosted on a platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

Let's break the project into smaller steps:
1. Building the Chatbot

The first step is to create a chatbot that can handle different use cases for interacting with the ERP system and possibly other systems. For this example, I will assume you are using Dialogflow for the chatbot creation and integration.
2. Integrating with ERP Systems via APIs

Your chatbot needs to interact with different ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics). These systems generally provide APIs that allow you to retrieve or manipulate data. We'll create API endpoints that the chatbot will call to fetch, update, or create data in the ERP system.
3. Hosting the Chatbot Publicly

You can host the chatbot on a cloud provider such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku, and expose it via a web interface for public interaction.
Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the Solution:
Step 1: Set up the Chatbot using Dialogflow

Dialogflow is a great tool for building conversational interfaces. We'll start by creating an agent in Dialogflow and define the intents that the bot should respond to (such as fetching ERP data).

1.1. Set up Dialogflow:

    Sign up for Dialogflow and create a new agent.
    Create intents such as:
        Get Inventory Info – To fetch inventory data.
        Create Sales Order – To create a sales order in ERP.
        Get Customer Info – To fetch customer details.

Each intent would have certain actions, and Dialogflow will send the user's queries to the respective intent.

# Install the Dialogflow library if you haven't already
pip install google-cloud-dialogflow

Step 2: Integrate Chatbot with ERP System

We'll create a Flask API that connects the Dialogflow chatbot with ERP systems. The bot will make HTTP requests to our API, and our API will interact with the ERP system.

2.1. Create API Endpoints:

Here’s an example Flask API that can interact with an ERP system (for example, fetching customer data from ERP via RESTful APIs).

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# Example: Fetch customer details from ERP (replace with real ERP API details)
def get_customer_data_from_erp(customer_id):
    erp_api_url = "https://your-erp-system.com/api/customer"
    response = requests.get(f"{erp_api_url}/{customer_id}")
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Could not fetch customer data"}

@app.route('/get_customer_info', methods=['POST'])
def get_customer_info():
    data = request.json
    customer_id = data.get('customer_id')
    
    # Get customer data from ERP
    customer_data = get_customer_data_from_erp(customer_id)
    
    # Return the ERP data to the chatbot
    return jsonify(customer_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Dialogflow Fulfillment with Flask

Dialogflow supports "Fulfillment" to send responses based on user queries. In this case, we can use our Flask API as the fulfillment webhook to interact with the ERP system.

3.1. Setup Dialogflow Webhook:

Go to Dialogflow Console > Fulfillment and enable Webhooks.

Then, set the webhook URL to your Flask API:

https://your-flask-app.com/get_customer_info

Now, when a user interacts with the chatbot and asks for customer details, the webhook will trigger the Flask API, which will fetch data from the ERP system and return it to the chatbot.
Step 4: Hosting the Chatbot Publicly

To make the chatbot publicly available, we can deploy it to Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

For simplicity, let's host it on Heroku.

4.1. Prepare Your Flask App for Deployment:

    Create a Procfile in your project folder to define the process:

web: python app.py

    Create requirements.txt by running the following command:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

    Initialize a git repository and commit your code:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

4.2. Deploy to Heroku:

    Sign up for Heroku and install the Heroku CLI.
    Log in to Heroku:

heroku login

    Create a new Heroku app:

heroku create your-app-name

    Push your code to Heroku:

git push heroku master

Heroku will automatically detect that it’s a Python app, install dependencies, and deploy it.

4.3. Expose your chatbot publicly:

After deploying, your chatbot will be available at https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com.
Step 5: Integrate with Front-End (Web Interface)

You can create a simple web interface where users can interact with the chatbot. You can use the Dialogflow Messenger SDK to embed the chatbot into your website.

    Go to your Dialogflow Console > Integrations > Web Demo.
    Copy the provided HTML code.
    Paste it into your website’s HTML to provide the chatbot interface.

Here’s an example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Chatbot</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Our ERP Chatbot</h1>
    <div id="dialogflow-messenger" 
         data-chatbot="https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client" 
         data-chatbot-id="your-agent-id">
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Now, the chatbot will be hosted publicly, and users can interact with it to fetch data from the ERP system.
Step 6: Finalize the Solution

After deploying the chatbot, it should be able to perform various tasks:

    Interact with the ERP system to fetch or update data.
    Respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
    Support multiple systems via API integrations.

Additional Features You Can Add:

    User Authentication: Add OAuth or token-based authentication to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive ERP data.
    Logging and Monitoring: Track chatbot performance and user interactions using tools like Google Analytics or custom logging.
    Advanced NLP: Use more advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to enhance chatbot accuracy and intelligence.
    Multi-language Support: Use Dialogflow's built-in support for multiple languages to cater to a wider audience.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll be able to build a chatbot that integrates with multiple systems like ERP systems, provides real-time data and responses to users, and can be hosted publicly on the web. You can easily extend the functionality by integrating additional systems, improving conversational abilities, and hosting the chatbot on various platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
